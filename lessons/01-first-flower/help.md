### Common Issues

**Canvas not displaying?**
- Make sure your code ends with `can` on the last line
- Check that you created the canvas: `can = Canvas(800, 600)`

**Colors not working?**
- Use `CreativeGardenPalette.COLOR_NAME` or `Color.COLOR_NAME`
- Try `can.show_palette(CreativeGardenPalette)` to see all colors

**Shapes in wrong position?**
- Use `can.grid(spacing=50, show_coords=True)` to see coordinates
- Remember: (0, 0) is top-left corner

### Tips

- Start simple: draw one shape at a time
- Use variables for positions to make adjustments easier
- Experiment with different sizes and colors
- Build up complexity gradually
