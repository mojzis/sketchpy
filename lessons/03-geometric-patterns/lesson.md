## ðŸ”· Project 3: Geometric Patterns

### Goal
Create repeating patterns using shapes and grids.

### What you'll learn
- Nested loops for grid patterns
- Drawing polygons and lines
- Creating symmetry and repetition
- Using the grid helper for alignment

### Steps
1. Enable grid to help with alignment: `can.grid()`
2. Draw a repeating pattern using nested loops
3. Experiment with shapes: circles, rectangles, polygons
4. Try different spacing and colors
5. Create your own unique pattern

### Pattern Ideas
- Checkerboard (alternating colors)
- Concentric circles
- Diagonal lines
- Repeating triangles
- Honeycomb pattern

### Challenge
Can you create a pattern that uses at least 2 different shapes? Try making it symmetrical!
