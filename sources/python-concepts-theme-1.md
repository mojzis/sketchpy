- Infinite loop prevention
- Conditionals inside loops
- Multiple loop conditions with `and`

**Visual Goal:** Traffic jam with cars drawn until canvas full

---

### Lesson 10: Compound Conditions
**Python Concepts:**
- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
- Complex decision trees
- Multiple condition evaluation
- Boolean logic combinations
- Parentheses for grouping conditions

**Visual Goal:** Smart traffic system with multiple decision factors

---

### Lesson 11: Basic Functions
**Python Concepts:**
- Function definition with `def`
- Function naming conventions
- Docstrings
- Function parameters
- Function calls
- Code organization and reusability
- Functions as "recipes"

**Visual Goal:** Vehicle factory with reusable drawing functions

---

### Lesson 12: Function Parameters
**Python Concepts:**
- Parameters vs arguments distinction
- Multiple parameters
- Flexible, configurable functions
- Proportional calculations from parameters
- Parameter-driven behavior

**Visual Goal:** Customizable cars with varying sizes, positions, colors

---

### Lesson 13: Return Values
**Python Concepts:**
- `return` statement
- Capturing returned values in variables
- Functions as calculations vs actions
- Immediate function exit on return
- Returning different data types
- Function composition

**Visual Goal:** Car drawing using functions that calculate and return values

---

### Lesson 14: Lists and Functions
**Python Concepts:**
- Dictionaries (key-value pairs)
- Dictionary access syntax: `dict['key']`
- Data-driven programming pattern
- Separating data from logic
- List of dictionaries
- Processing structured data
- Scalable code architecture

**Visual Goal:** Traffic scene with cars defined as data structures

---

### Lesson 15: Final Project
**Python Concepts:**
- **Integration of all concepts:**
  - Functions for organization
  - Nested loops for patterns
  - Conditionals for logic
  - Lists and dictionaries for data
  - String formatting for labels
- Layering and drawing order
- Code organization strategies
- Project planning and structure
- Comments and documentation

**Visual Goal:** Complete city traffic scene with buildings, vehicles, roads, landscaping

## Pedagogical Approach

**Visual-First Learning:** Every concept is immediately applied to create visual output, providing instant feedback and motivation.

**Incremental Complexity:** Each lesson builds directly on previous concepts, with minimal cognitive load increases.

**Practical Application:** Concepts are taught in context of solving real drawing problems, not as abstract theory.

**Creative Expression:** Students have freedom to customize and extend projects, encouraging experimentation.

**Real-World Patterns:** Later lessons introduce professional programming patterns (data-driven design, separation of concerns).

## Key Skills by End of Curriculum

Students will be able to:
- Write and call functions with parameters and return values
- Use loops (for/while) and nested loops for patterns
- Work with lists and dictionaries to manage data
- Apply conditional logic with boolean operators
- Format strings and display text
- Organize code into logical, reusable components
- Plan and build complex multi-function projects
- Debug and refine their code iteratively
