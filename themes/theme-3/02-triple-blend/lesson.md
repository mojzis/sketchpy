## â­• Project 2: Triple Blend

### Goal
Create a triangle of three overlapping circles using all three palette colors and discover what happens in the center.

### What you'll learn
- Drawing multiple circles in sequence
- Using all three triadic colors (blue, rose, mint)
- How three transparent colors mix together
- Positioning shapes to create intentional overlaps

### Color Theory Magic
When MIST_BLUE + MIST_ROSE + MIST_MINT overlap in the center, they create a subtle neutral grey-brown color. This is because the three colors are evenly spaced on the color wheel (triadic harmony)!

### Steps
1. Draw a blue circle at the top
2. Draw a rose circle at the bottom-left
3. Draw a mint circle at the bottom-right
4. Notice the 7 different color regions created!

### Triangle Positions
To make a triangle, position circles like this:
- Top: `(400, 250)`
- Bottom-left: `(320, 380)`
- Bottom-right: `(480, 380)`

### The Seven Regions
1. Pure blue (top)
2. Pure rose (bottom-left)
3. Pure mint (bottom-right)
4. Blue + Rose = Purple (top-left)
5. Blue + Mint = Cyan (top-right)
6. Rose + Mint = Peach (bottom)
7. All three = Neutral grey (center)

### Challenge
Can you adjust the positions to make the overlaps bigger or smaller? Try changing the radius to 150!
