## â­• Project 15: Meditative Masterpiece

### Goal
Create your own unique meditative artwork by combining all the techniques you've learned - mandalas, spirals, grids, colors, and patterns.

### What you'll learned (Everything!)
- Canvas and backgrounds
- Opacity and transparency
- Loops (for, while, nested)
- Lists and dictionaries
- Functions and parameters
- Return values
- Trigonometry and math
- Conditional logic
- Data-driven design

### Your Creative Toolkit
You now have the power to create:
- **Mandalas**: Circular arrangements with `cos()` and `sin()`
- **Spirals**: Growing patterns with while loops
- **Grids**: Nested loops for 2D arrangements
- **Concentric patterns**: Rings that drift and fade
- **Color mixing**: Transparent overlaps creating new colors
- **Functions**: Reusable pattern generators
- **Data-driven**: Compositions from configuration

### Final Project Ideas

**1. Kaleidoscope**
- Multiple overlapping mandalas
- Each with different sizes and colors
- Create reflective symmetry

**2. Sacred Geometry**
- Vesica piscis patterns (overlapping circles)
- Flower of Life (concentric mandalas)
- Combine circular and grid layouts

**3. Abstract Landscape**
- Concentric rings as "hills"
- Spirals as "paths"
- Color gradients for depth

**4. Meditation Mandala**
- Large central mandala (12+ circles)
- Smaller satellite mandalas
- Subtle color transitions

### Steps to Create Your Masterpiece
1. Plan your composition on paper first
2. Choose 1-3 colors from MathDoodlingPalette
3. Combine 2-3 different patterns
4. Use functions to organize your code
5. Experiment with opacity and sizing
6. Add personal touches!

### Tips for Success
- Start simple, add complexity gradually
- Use opacity 0.15-0.35 for best blending
- Keep code organized with functions
- Comment your creative decisions
- Try unexpected combinations!

### Challenge
Create something that represents YOU:
- Your favorite colors
- Your personality (calm/energetic)
- Your artistic vision
- What meditation means to you

**There's no right answer - just pure creativity!**
