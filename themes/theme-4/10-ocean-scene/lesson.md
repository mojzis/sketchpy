## 🌊 Final Project: Complete Ocean Scene

### Goal
Combine everything you've learned to create a beautiful, complete ocean scene!

### Your Mission
Create a rich underwater world using all your Python skills:
- Variables for organization
- Loops for patterns
- Lists for variety
- Dictionaries for complex scenes

### Requirements
Your scene should have:
1. **Ocean floor**: Multiple seaweed (use a loop!)
2. **Mid-water**: 5+ jellyfish swimming
3. **Reef creatures**: 3+ octopuses in different positions
4. **Variety**: Different sizes and colors

### Bonus Challenges
- Create depth: smaller creatures in background, larger in foreground
- Add patterns: seaweed forest with regular spacing
- Color zones: use different colors for different depths
- Animation idea: creatures at calculated positions

### Planning Tips
1. Sketch on paper first - where will creatures go?
2. Start with ocean floor (seaweed)
3. Add background creatures (small, high up)
4. Add foreground creatures (large, lower down)
5. Test frequently - press Ctrl-Enter often!

### Celebration
When done, you've learned:
- ✅ Variables
- ✅ Loops
- ✅ Lists  
- ✅ Dictionaries
- ✅ Creating complex scenes with code!

You're now an Ocean Explorer programmer! 🐙🎉
