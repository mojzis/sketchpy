## 📦 Variables: Your Storage Boxes

### Goal
Learn how variables store values you can reuse and change.

### What You'll Learn
- Variables are like labeled boxes that hold values
- Changing a variable changes everything that uses it
- You can use variables for positions, sizes, and colors

### The Code Explained
```python
x = 400          # Octopus will be at x position 400
y = 300          # Octopus will be at y position 300
octopus_size = 120  # Octopus size is 120 pixels
```

When you change `x = 400` to `x = 200`, the octopus moves left!

### Try This
1. Press **Ctrl-Enter** to see three octopuses
2. Change `x1 = 200` to `x1 = 100` - watch the first octopus move
3. Change `big_size = 150` to `big_size = 200` - make the big one bigger!
4. Try making all octopuses the same size

### Key Concept
Instead of writing `ocean.octopus(200, 300, size=120)` three times with different numbers, we use variables to make the code clearer and easier to change.

### Challenge
Can you add a fourth octopus? Remember to create new variables like `x4` and `y4`!
