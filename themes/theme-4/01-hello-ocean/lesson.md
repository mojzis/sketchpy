## 🐙 Hello Ocean!

### Goal
See your first Python code come to life - just press a button!

### What You'll Do
1. Press **Ctrl-Enter** (or **Cmd-Enter** on Mac) to run the code
2. Watch a cute octopus appear!
3. Try changing the numbers and run again

### The Magic
The code is already written for you. Your only job: press **Ctrl-Enter** and watch what happens!

### Try This
After you see the octopus, try changing these numbers:
- Change `400` to `200` - where does the octopus move?
- Change `300` to `150` - what happens now?
- Change `size=120` to `size=200` - how does it grow?

### What's Happening?
- `Canvas(800, 600)` - Creates your drawing space
- `OceanShapes(can)` - Gives you ocean creature superpowers
- `octopus(400, 300, size=120)` - Draws an octopus at position (400, 300) with size 120

Don't worry about understanding everything yet. Just experiment and have fun!

### Challenge
Can you make the octopus bigger? Smaller? Move it to the corner?

### Next Lesson
You'll learn what those numbers mean and create your own underwater scene!
