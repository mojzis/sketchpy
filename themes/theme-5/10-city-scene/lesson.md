## 🌆 Final Project: Your City

### Goal
Combine everything you've learned to create an amazing city traffic scene!

### What You've Learned
✅ Variables - store and reuse values
✅ Loops - repeat code efficiently
✅ Functions - organize and reuse code blocks
✅ Conditionals - make smart decisions

### Your Mission
Create a complete city scene using ALL these concepts:
- Multiple roads or lanes
- Many vehicles (cars, buses, sports cars)
- Traffic lights
- Patterns and variety
- Your own creative touches!

### Requirements
Try to include:
1. **Variables** - for colors, positions, sizes
2. **Loops** - to create multiple vehicles
3. **Functions** - to organize your code
4. **Conditionals** - to add variety

### Project Ideas

**Idea 1: Busy Intersection**
- Two roads crossing
- Traffic lights in all directions
- Cars waiting at red lights
- Different vehicle types

**Idea 2: Highway Scene**
- Multi-lane highway
- Cars at different speeds (different spacing)
- Mix of vehicle types
- Background (sky, ground)

**Idea 3: Parking Garage**
- Multiple levels
- Grid of parking spaces
- Different cars in each space
- Some empty spaces

**Idea 4: Your Own City**
- Design your dream traffic scene!
- Combine elements from other ideas
- Add creative details

### Tips
- Start simple, add complexity gradually
- Use functions to organize complex scenes
- Test often as you build
- Have fun and be creative!

### Example Structure
```python
# 1. Setup and background

# 2. Define functions
def draw_something():
    pass

# 3. Draw roads

# 4. Use loops for repetition
for i in range(n):
    if condition:
        # Variety
    else:
        # More variety

# 5. Add details
```

### Challenge
Make your scene extra impressive:
- Use gradients for realistic sky
- Add buildings or trees
- Create a roundabout
- Animate traffic (different positions suggest movement)
- Add road markings and signs
