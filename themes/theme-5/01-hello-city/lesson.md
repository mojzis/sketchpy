## 🏙️ Welcome to City Drivers!

### Goal
Create your first city scene with a car on a road.

### What You'll Learn
- How to create a canvas (drawing area)
- How to draw a road
- How to draw a car
- Understanding x and y coordinates

### Your First City Scene
The code shows three simple steps:
1. `can = Canvas(800, 600)` - Create a drawing area
2. `cars.road(...)` - Draw a road
3. `cars.rounded_car(...)` - Draw a modern, curvy car

### Coordinates Explained
- `x` is the position left-to-right (0 is left edge)
- `y` is the position top-to-bottom (0 is top edge)
- The road is at y=400 (400 pixels from the top)
- The car is at position x=200, y=350

### Try This
1. Run the code to see your first car!
2. Change the car's x position (try 400 instead of 200)
3. Change the car's color to Color.RED or Color.GREEN
4. Add a second car at a different position

### Challenge
Can you add three cars driving on the road at different positions?
