### Common Issues with Large Projects

**Code is too long and confusing?**

- Break it into functions with clear names
- Group related functions together with comments
- Each function should do ONE thing well
- Use helper functions to simplify complex tasks

**Can't figure out where to start?**

1. Start with the background (simplest elements)
2. Add one complex element at a time
3. Test after each addition
4. Build from back to front (layering)

**Elements appearing in wrong order?**

- Drawing order matters! Later code draws on top
- Draw backgrounds first, foregrounds last
- Use comments to mark drawing order: `# Layer 1: Sky`, `# Layer 2: Buildings`, etc.

**Coordinates are confusing?**

- Use `can.grid(spacing=50, show_coords=True)` to see coordinates
- Use variables for important positions: `road_y = 300`
- Draw a sketch on paper with coordinates labeled
- Start with one element and position others relative to it

**Too many magic numbers in code?**

```python
# Hard to understand
can.rect(50, 120, 90, 80, fill=Color.GRAY)

# Better with variables
building_x = 50
building_y = 120
building_width = 90
building_height = 80
can.rect(building_x, building_y, building_width, building_height, fill=Color.GRAY)

# Even better with descriptive names
office_building_x = 50
office_building_y = 120
office_building_width = 90
office_building_height = 80
can.rect(office_building_x, office_building_y, office_building_width, office_building_height, fill=Color.GRAY)
```

### Project Organization Strategies

**Function categories:**

```python
# ============ CONSTANTS ============
CANVAS_WIDTH = 800
CANVAS_HEIGHT = 600
ROAD_Y = 300

# ============ BACKGROUND FUNCTIONS ============
def draw_sky(canvas):
    pass

def draw_buildings(canvas):
    pass

# ============ OBJECT FUNCTIONS ============
def draw_car(canvas, x, y, color):
    pass

# ============ SCENE COMPOSITION ============
can = Canvas(CANVAS_WIDTH, CANVAS_HEIGHT)
draw_sky(can)
# ... etc
```

**Progressive complexity:**

```python
# Version 1: Basic shapes only
def draw_building_v1(canvas, x, y):
    canvas.rect(x, y, 100, 150, fill=Color.GRAY)

# Version 2: Add windows
def draw_building_v2(canvas, x, y):
    canvas.rect(x, y, 100, 150, fill=Color.GRAY)
    for i in range(5):
        canvas.rect(x + 20, y + 20 + i * 25, 15, 20, fill=Color.YELLOW)

# Version 3: Add parameters for customization
def draw_building_v3(canvas, x, y, width, height, window_color):
    canvas.rect(x, y, width, height, fill=Color.GRAY)
    # ... window logic
```

### Debugging Large Projects

**Isolate problems:**

```python
# Comment out everything except what you're debugging
draw_sky(can)
# draw_buildings(can)  # Commented out
# draw_road(can)  # Commented out
draw_sedan(can, 100, 200, Color.RED)  # Testing this only
```

**Use print statements:**

```python
def draw_car(canvas, x, y, color):
    print(f"Drawing car at ({x}, {y}) with color {color}")
    # ... rest of function
```

**Build incrementally:**

```python
# Step 1: Just the body
def draw_car_step1(canvas, x, y, color):
    canvas.rect(x, y, 150, 70, fill=color)

# Step 2: Add wheels
def draw_car_step2(canvas, x, y, color):
    canvas.rect(x, y, 150, 70, fill=color)
    canvas.circle(x + 30, y + 80, 15, fill=Color.BLACK)
    canvas.circle(x + 120, y + 80, 15, fill=Color.BLACK)

# Step 3: Add windows, etc.
```

### Tips for Adding New Elements

**Process for adding something new:**

1. **Plan:**
   What do you want to add? Draw it on paper.
2. **Position:**
   Where on the canvas? Use grid to find coordinates.
3. **Function:**
   Create a new function for it.
4. **Test:**
   Test the function by itself first.
5. **Integrate:**
   Add it to your main scene.
6. **Refine:**
   Adjust position, colors, size.

**Example: Adding a cloud**

```python
# 1. Create function
def draw_cloud(canvas, x, y):
    # Cloud is made of overlapping circles
    canvas.circle(x, y, 30, fill=Color.WHITE)
    canvas.circle(x + 25, y - 10, 25, fill=Color.WHITE)
    canvas.circle(x + 50, y, 30, fill=Color.WHITE)
    canvas.circle(x + 25, y + 10, 20, fill=Color.WHITE)

# 2. Test it first
can = Canvas(800, 600)
can.rect(0, 0, 800, 600, fill=CalmOasisPalette.SKY_BLUE)  # Sky background
draw_cloud(can, 200, 100)
can

# 3. Once working, add to main scene
draw_sky(can)
draw_cloud(can, 200, 100)
draw_cloud(can, 500, 120)
draw_cloud(can, 350, 80)
```

### Performance Tips

**If your scene is slow to draw:**

- Reduce the number of shapes (especially small repeated elements)
- Combine shapes where possible
- Use simpler shapes (rectangles instead of polygons)
- Comment out complex elements while testing

### Common Patterns to Reuse

**Regular spacing:**

```python
# Trees at regular intervals
for i in range(5):
    tree_x = 100 + i * 150
    draw_tree(can, tree_x, 450)
```

**Random variation:**

```python
import random

# Buildings with random heights
for i in range(6):
    building_x = 50 + i * 120
    building_height = random.randint(80, 180)
    draw_building(can, building_x, 200 - building_height, building_height)
```

**Conditional appearance:**

```python
# Alternate colors
for i in range(10):
    color = Color.RED if i % 2 == 0 else Color.BLUE
    draw_car(can, 50 + i * 80, 300, color)
```

**Grid patterns:**

```python
# Windows in a grid
for row in range(4):
    for col in range(3):
        window_x = building_x + 20 + col * 30
        window_y = building_y + 30 + row * 35
        can.rect(window_x, window_y, 20, 25, fill=Color.YELLOW)
```

### Troubleshooting Checklist

When something goes wrong:
- [ ] Check the console for error messages
- [ ] Verify coordinate values (use grid)
- [ ] Check function calls (right number of parameters?)
- [ ] Verify drawing order (background before foreground?)
- [ ] Check for typos in variable names
- [ ] Ensure colors are properly defined
- [ ] Test functions individually before combining
- [ ] Check that canvas size is correct (800, 600)

### Getting Unstuck

**If you're stuck:**

1. Take a break - fresh eyes help
2. Simplify - comment out complex parts
3. Go back to basics - does a simple shape work?
4. Read the error message carefully
5. Check similar examples in earlier lessons
6. Try explaining your code out loud (rubber duck debugging!)
