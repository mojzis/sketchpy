## ðŸŒ» Project 2: Colorful Garden

### Goal
Draw multiple flowers using loops and create a garden scene.

### What you'll learn
- Using `for` loops to draw multiple shapes
- Creating variations with randomness (or patterns)
- Composing complex scenes from simple shapes
- Working with both color palettes

### Steps
1. Create a canvas: `can = Canvas(800, 600)`
2. Draw a background (sky and grass)
3. Use a loop to draw multiple flowers at different positions
4. Experiment with different flower colors and sizes
5. Add details (sun, clouds, butterflies)

### Tips
- Use a `for` loop: `for i in range(5):`
- Vary positions: `x = 100 + i * 150`
- Mix colors from `CreativeGardenPalette` and `CalmOasisPalette`
- Layer elements (draw background first, then flowers)

### Challenge
Can you create a garden with 5-10 flowers? Try adding a sun in the corner and some grass at the bottom!
