DEAR CLAUDE, please dont edit this.

# ERRORS


## meta stuff
- claude skills 🚧
 - testing ?
- ideas interchange with claude.ai 🚧
 - not sure whether / how this makes sense ...
- ci/cd
 - (some) tests ?
- tests 
 - for javascript features ? 🚧
 - review and fix browser tests 🚧
 - test the lib on python per pyodide (3.13 after update)
 - make test setup smarter for claude ✈️
- license ? (not copyright ...)
- changelog for lib
- ruff, ty (?)
- jsdoc - mentioned in js tooling last phase
- readme - simplify, add notes about further development ?

## CLAUDE
- fix lesson creation skill
 - symmetry, depth, order of layers ... 
 - functions

## canvas lib
- curves ✈️
- pipe function

## layout & format
- allow user to move canvas vs code border
- link to home ?
- consider vertical layout option ?

## content
- help
 - canvas - generated from code (meticulously explain each param)
 - python - basic principles, with examples (as links to editor ?) ☮️

 - initial intro to the page - this is the editor, this is where the image will appear
 - initial intro to the lib - setup canvas, draw a circle, draw another on top of it


I would like to split the content of the help tab into 3:
- the actual content for the lesson
- help for the sketchpy lib (ideally generated from the lib itself)
- 


- lesson desc vs help panel


## features
- "free editor" 
- ERRORS - still needs love ! 🚧
 - just minor styling improvements 
- nicer homepage 🚧
 - add usual stuff like favicon ...
 - add social links
 - colored code !
 - even better pictures :)
- theme switching
  - create lessons per theme though ?
- save code to github gists ☮️
- sharing ✈️
- palletes
  - add a function to show the current pallete, ✅
  - pick palletes,
  - switch pallets
  - nicer way in the code
 - ai
  - document sketch lib
  - llm.txt file


## much later
- store code in browser ?
- add color picker ?
- i18n ? :)

## NTH
auto reload in browser for development ?
- drawing lib - make it faster to load ?

## DONE
- canvas: add a posibility to show a grid
- improve editor experience  (- use a better code editor - like we have in streamlit ?)
- when i run uv srv, it should restart if running
- newer pyodide
